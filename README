An attempt at setting up useful benchmarks for Adobe Alchemy (C/C++ to Flash compiler)

C/C++ Benchmarks sources :
http://stlab.adobe.com/performance/
http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/

STLAB :
All benchmarks can be tested in Flash.

NETLIB :
whetstone can be tested, but only with low loopcount parameter.
linpackc-new compiles, but i've been unable to get results in Flash, maybe just cause of execution time limit.
